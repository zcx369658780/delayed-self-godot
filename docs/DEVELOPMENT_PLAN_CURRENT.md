# Development plan (CURRENT)

The canonical milestone detail remains in the [GDD](game_design/DELAYED_SELF_GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT_CURRENT.md). This document records the execution spine without inventing implementation tasks beyond Task 0003.

## Near-term gates

```text
0000 governance bootstrap
→ 0001 read-only environment and release-target inventory
→ 0002 gameplay simulation contract
→ 0003 minimal vertical slice
```

Task 0001 inventories installed Godot/export tooling and evaluates Windows/Web targets without upgrades or downloads. Task 0002 freezes deterministic state transition, collision/settlement order, level schema, and solver/runtime contract. Task 0003 implements one minimal validated room and its conformance harness.

Tasks 0000–0002 are GPT accepted. Task 0003 implementation is complete pending GPT review. The recommended next gate after acceptance is Task 0004 for first-player UX, visual readability, and manual review; export remains a separate Task 0004E gate.

## Milestone spine

| Milestone | Dates | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Rules and repository freeze | 2026-07-14–07-15 | Governance plus read-only environment inventory |
| M1 Minimal vertical slice | 2026-07-16–07-19 | One understandable, validated delayed-echo puzzle |
| M2 System skeleton | 2026-07-20–07-24 | Data-driven levels, core flow, four validated levels |
| M3 Content production | 2026-07-25–07-31 | Eight candidate levels and first coherent presentation |
| M4 Complete flow | 2026-08-01–08-05 | Menu-to-ending flow, settings, save, license page, export |
| M5 Candidate | 2026-08-06–08-10 | P0/P1 closure and independent review candidate |
| M6 Polish and final submission | 2026-08-11–09-06 | Final audit, stable package, separately authorized submission |
| M7 Video | by 2026-09-10 | Gameplay/theme presentation |

If the vertical slice, solver/runtime parity, or complete flow misses the GDD gates, reduce optional levels, languages, controller support, shaders, and extra mechanics before reducing the core delayed-echo loop or complete product flow.
